                My name is Collin Palm and I am an Undergraduate student of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.
                I built this website to show off some of my developer skills and projects I have participated in.  This site is 
                only ever going to be a frontend with no data worth hacking this site for... so please don't. However, if you simply
                cannot help yourself, at least head over to github and drop me a note letting me know what the vulnerability is so
                I can fix it
