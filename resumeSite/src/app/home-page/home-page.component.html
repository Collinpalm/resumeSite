            This is a site I built to show off my skills and ideas.  Feel free to
            take a look around, I hope you like what you see.  All the source code 
            for this site is on my Github page, the link is located in the dropdown 
            menu in the toolbar.  This site is only a frontend with absoluely no 
            vital information, or really anthing valueable, to gain by hacking it... 
            so please don't.  However, if you simply cannot help yourself, at least
            send me a message on Github with the vulnerablity so I can fix it.
